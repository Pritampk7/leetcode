"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 200","","Haath aao toh butta, haath na aao toh khuda ho… If anyone can hold you, you are merely an idol and if they can’t reach you, you are God, is a Sufi saying I’ve heard from Swamiji a few times in his discourses."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 222","","Always to Her auspicious feet first, as I had heard Swamiji say time and again that without Her blessings one couldn’t hope to find Bhagavān."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 463","","If a sannyasi is pure at heart and has also done sadhana, then there is nothing more one can have or acquire, to help and benefit other people."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 471","","You would have to return for the fulfillment of that wish, because a blessing of a saint is attached to it. Just because of that one desire and fulfilment of that word, you may have to come back, because nature always operates on its own time scale. Which is why one should be very careful what they wish for and ask for from anyone, especially Bhagavān."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 474","","You should think hard before you ask for things, because that may be the only reason why most of you are on this planet earth today. It’s because of the things you wanted in your previous lifetimes and you’re getting some of those fulfilled now."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 480","","It has no prejudice. Whatever life gives you, if you accept it gracefully, gratefully, happily and even willingly, then you make your own life easier. However, if you resist and battle with yourself and life, nothing will come of it, except suffering."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 500","","this is how Bhagavān must be, ever kind, ever loving and ever filled with laughter and kind mischief."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 526","","simple: one round of Guru-mantra and Ramcharitmanas daily."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 531","","Beginning with the Arti, followed by the Srividya stuti, hymn, finishing with a round of the Guru mantra. This simple pooja routine of twenty minutes in the next seven years would grow to two hours. But of course, back then it was inconceivable to me."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 582","","It took two months to read the Ramcharitmanas."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 600","","“Obtaining a human body is rare, but through taking the name of Hari unfortunate souls are purified. O brother! Tulsi says that there is no one like Jagadamba (the Divine Mother) in all the three worlds.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 701","","Mother Divine has appeared to bless the family because they look after you, care for you with love, Sadhviji. Maa Annapurna has blessed them."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 709","","My life since Swamiji’s arrival has only been filled with miracles after miracles."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 802","","‘Well, not as happy as you are here. All worldly relationships come with their fair share of stress… and no you wouldn’t have had any children if that’s what you are thinking.’"

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 837","","“That’s all we can see for now,” as if some day, with more powerful telescopes in orbit beyond the moon, we might be able to see it all."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 840","","The speed of light itself limits us to a kind of bubble of observation in space-time, beyond which we simply cannot perceive. No messages can reach us from beyond that bubble, and none can be sent. But that does not mean there is nothing beyond;"

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 850","","the stars in them may be separated by thousands of years, as we measure from here on earth. Space and time, bound together, inevitably limit and distort the validity of what we can say about the universe. But these dimensions do not apply to the Lord. In the Hindu scriptures we find the provoking statement that this vast cosmos is one thought of the Lord. That is as long as our universe lasts: one thought."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 856","","the one firmly established in the mode of goodness, there are no separate individual embodied souls but simply one supreme soul. For such a person the boundaries of time and space disappear. That is precisely how I have seen him operate on countless occasions."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 984","","Dogs are never attached to their masters the way humans are attached to their people and pets. Dogs don’t worry about the future or brood over the past. They have no ego. Absolutely no ego at all. So, they love back whoever offers them love and food."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1055","","If you remember, I had asked you to give me ten minutes to rest up in the guest room, which had also been your mother’s room when she was alive. Well, she was still in that room and wished to speak to me. All her life she had had myriad worldly desires, but they hadn’t brought her any happiness. She didn’t want that for you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1079","","I felt such gratitude for my beautiful Guru, whose heart was tender like a child and who gave away everything he had for the happiness and comfort of others."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1081","","This incident also forever changed my outlook on death. No one was really dying, they were all there on the other side, in a prison of their making. Death was not a release as I had thought (and countless others think), it was merely another trap for the ones who didn’t know how to live. I also now laugh at the idea of all those people seeking moksha in the other life. It wasn’t possible, not without achieving liberation from one’s negative tendencies while alive."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1086","","Women’s Liberation Group (WLG) on Wildr. Having seen how tough mamma’s life had been, I realized that women were often neglected and neglect themselves even in the most supportive families. They spent their lives looking after everyone but never really took out the time to embark on their own spiritual quest until very late in life."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1097","","I felt as if time was running out for me as well, I had to learn to live, truly live before I died, else nothing good would come from my passing either. I realized then more than ever that my Guru was my salvation. And death that seemed like a sweet, peaceful sleep was in reality a lengthy nightmare for the ignorant."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1181","","For by now, I knew that people on the other side were well and alive. The ones who knew how to yoke their consciousness to Bhagavān, neither space nor time could bind them. They were the awakened ones."
"Highlight (Pink)","Location 1183","","a life without Bhagavān in it was only endless suffering, there was no peace for them even in death. As for the awakened, realized souls, they were free from birth, death and decay."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1308","","‘Is this what you meant in 2016 when you said in a different life, I’d have had to undergo long chemo sessions, Swamiji?’ ‘Lymphoma, cancer of the lymph nodes, is what it’s called,’ he said nodding, ‘but there’s nothing to worry about now, Bhikkuram, all’s well with Her grace.’ The heaviness and pain in my arm took a few months to disappear. I still can feel the discomfort sometimes but mostly it’s fine."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1330","","I went to Sri Hari and said through a haze of tears, ‘If you are okay with me looking like this, then I’m okay looking this way.’ Bhagavān’s eyes brimming with love, brought me peace and an acceptance that I didn’t think was possible so soon."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1467","","can say with certainty that this business with the chapati had mystified me even more than the other hair-raising feats I’ve seen Swamiji do. To have such authority over the nature of things, tangible and intangible, so as to command them to change their course at such a micro level was beyond my comprehension. Try as I may, I couldn’t make sense of the mysterious forces that were at his beck and call. For how could one possibly make a chapati in the world rise by commanding it so?"
